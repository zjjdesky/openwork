## Security Best Practices for Users

When using openwork:

1. **API Keys**: Store API keys securely using environment variables rather than hardcoding them.
2. **Sensitive Data**: Be cautious when giving agents access to directories containing sensitive information.
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Use the approval system for sensitive operations.
4. **Updates**: Keep openwork updated to receive security patches.
